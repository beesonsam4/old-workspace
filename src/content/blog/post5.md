Learning how to conduct different styles of music is all part of the fun for becoming a better educator, and it’s one of the pieces of the puzzle that really makes me tick. The Bronco Marching Band Trumpets gave me many chances to conduct them, and I’m grateful for all the laughs and experience they gave me. This recording is one of the last things we did together for the 2022 season. The WMU Conducting classes have also given me tremendous amounts of practice to refine my craft, and while I have a **long** way to go, here’s some of my better performances.
