Concert band is one of the most important facets of music education, and I am confident that my experience under many different conductors playing a wide variety of repertoire that I can provide a complete experience to my students. I played in the Kalamazoo Valley Community College Concert Band in 2019 on Trumpet and Timpani, was Principal Trumpet in the Western Michigan University Concert Band in the Fall of 2021, Principal Trumpet of Western Michigan Universityâ€™s Symphonic Band in Spring and Fall of 2022, and a member of University Symphony Orchestra in Spring 2023. Additionally, I have been a member of Quintessential Brass Quintet since fall of 2022, which has been an essential asset to my growth as a musician and an educator.
