Marching Band is one of the very cornerstones of my love for music. It is an integral part to the development of a complete musician, and brings such vibrance to the students and the community alike. Iâ€™m also very experienced in this sector, having done four years in high school, two years at WMU in the Bronco Marching Band, one summer with Legends Drum and Bugle Corps in 2019, and toured with the Boston Crusaders in 2022 and 2023. I have also actively taught as a visual and brass caption head since the fall of 2019 at various schools. I am fluent in both Musescore and Sibelius to write Marching Band arrangements, as well as Pyware to write drill .
